# US River Basin Information #

This website provides data and information for river basins in the United States.

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is in the process of developing this
website to provide access to cross-jurisdictional datasets and information products for river basins,
to understand water resources issues for different topics, with temporal and spatial perspectives.
The information products support learning, dialogue, collaboration, and decision-making.

The website also provides navigation to more specific basin resources implemented using the OWF InfoMapper software.

**This website is under development.**
