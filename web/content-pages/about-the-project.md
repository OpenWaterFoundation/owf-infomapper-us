# About the US River Basins Information Project #

The [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise
that develops open source software and open data solutions to make better decisions about water.
This website serves the following purposes:

* provide a resource for water-related information about US river basins
* provide navigation to more specific websites for specific river basins

This website is currently implemented as a demonstration to highlight more specific work
at the Open Water Foundation, including detailed river basin websites.

**This website is under development.  OWF uses its own resources for research and development and is
seeking additional funding to develop open source software and informational websites.**
