# Reporting an Issue #

The US River Basin Information website is designed to be simple to use.
However, the underlying application involves many data files and
the software features are advanced in order to provide data viewing capabilities in a web browser.
Technical issues can occur because of data, configuration, software, and network problems.

See the list of common issues in the next section.
If necessary, report an issue using the
[software repository issues page](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-infomapper-us)
or by emailing the contact (see the ***Resources / Contact*** menu).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

The following are common issues and possible solutions.

| **Issue** | **Possible Solution**
| -- | -- |
| Website does not display properly on mobile device. | The website is designed for desktop computers.  Although the software technologies being used are compatible with mobile devices, the complexity of maps and data visualizations may not display well on the small screens of mobile devices. |
| Map is slow to load | Some maps display large datasets and are slow to load.  The website is being updated to provide data loading feedback.  Viewing complex maps may require more computer memory and faster internet for better performance. |
| Hovering over a feature causes flashing. | The popup dialog used to display information when hovering over a feature may flash when the dialog displays over the feature.  To avoid flashing, pan the map so that the feature of interest is not under the popup dialog location.  Or, click on the menu or arrow icons at the top of the map legend to hide the legend, which will shift the popup dialog location.  Software enhancements are being evaluated to avoid this issue.|
